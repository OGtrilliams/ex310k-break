Ceph, if previously installed, has been completely removed from your
environment. You now have a clean slate. Perform the following tasks, starting
with reinstalling Ceph using the method of your choosing.

1. Install Ceph Kraken (stable) using the disk mounted on /mnt/ex310 as your
OSD location. You can use whatever deployment method you prefer. Cephx
authentication is not required.
2. Add ceph as a backend for OpenStack Glance. 
3. Verify installation by creating a fedora-atomic image
(https://getfedora.org/en/atomic/download/) using appropriate settings.
4. Create a 5GB Cinder volume named cephalopod using the Ceph RBD backend
under the rainbow project. 
5. Add a project named rainbow. Under this project create the following users.
All users should have the password openstack.
    - Rose
    - Orenthal
    - Yolanda
    - Gene
    - Britney
    - Ivan
    - Victoria
6. Add ceph as a backend for Cinder. 
7. Under the rainbow project, create a new, public network with the following
settings:
    - Name: prism
    - subnet: 172.24.1.0/24
    - subnet range: 172.24.1.100 - 172.24.1.199
    - gateway: 172.24.1.1
    - DNS server: 8.8.8.8
    - DHCP disabled
8. Create two new server flavors with the following settings:
    - c1.small - 1GB RAM, 10GB root disk, 20GB ephemeral disk, 1 vCPU
    - c1.med - 2GB RAM, 12GB root disk, 40GB ephemeral disk, 2vCPUs
9. Add ceph as a backend for Nova. 
10. Under the rainbow project, create a new server named webserver using the
c1.small flavor and fedora-atomic image, connected to the prism-internal
network. The webserver should be behind the web-lb load balancer.
11. Add the floating IP address 172.24.1.140 to webserver.
12. Under the rainbow project, create a c1.small server using the
fedora-atomic image named webserver2, connected to the prism-internal network.
The webserver should be behind the web-lb load balancer.
13. Create a security group named webserver-sg that permits both secure and
insecure web traffic, ssh access, and ping. Add the security group to
webserver and webserver2.
14. Create a load balancer named web-lb using the round robin protocol. The
webserver should permit both insecure and secure web traffic, and should be
connected to the prism-internal network.
15. Add a web health monitor to the web-lb load balancer that will check each
node every 30 seconds, with a 10 second timeout, with a maximum of 5 retries
before failure.
16. Assign the VIP 172.24.1.170 to the web-lb load balancer.
